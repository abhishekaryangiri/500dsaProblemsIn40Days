//Best time to buy and Sell stock
//Given an array prices[] of length N, representing the prices of the stocks on different days, the task is to find the maximum profit possible for buying and selling the stocks on different days using transactions where at most one transaction is allowed.
//Input: prices[] = {7, 1, 5, 3, 6, 4]
//Output: 5
//Explanation:
//The lowest price of the stock is on the 2nd day, i.e. price = 1. Starting from the 2nd day, the highest price of the stock is witnessed on the 5th day, i.e. price = 6. 
//Therefore, maximum possible profit = 6 â€“ 1 = 5.
